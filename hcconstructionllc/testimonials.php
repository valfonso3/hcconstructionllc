We had two custom bathrooms remodeled (almost brand new) by Luis. Plus the outside patio 32 feet by 10 feet. Patio grading was perfect, which was one of our main concerns. Bathroom tiles and glass, floor, walls, vanity, shower stall, custom bench, soap nook, everything was done to our satisfaction. Luis was recommended by a friend and we recommended Luis to several of our friends and family who were also very happy.</blockquote>
